    <h2><blockquote> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement </blockquote></h2>
    <p><blockquote>A brief description of Progressive Enhancement would be a blueprint in web design that puts prominence or importance on web content first. It focuses more on the content than the browser support technologies and support. This technique involves separating the visual elements of the presentation semantics or the Linked Data from the content, with presentation being implemented in one or more layers, activated based on aspects of the internet connection of the user. It's a design ideaology that provides a baseline of content and functionality to many users, especially those with experience using the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.  </blockquote></p>
    <p><blockquote> Progressive Enhancement improves the users experience. Buildig a site with Progressive Enhancement makes the site easier to maintain than other sites. Not only does PE benefit users who are using outdated browsers, it also benefits other user browsers such as Mobile browsers. Mobile browsers that don't support CSS or JavaScript can still display the content of a web site. While some of the modern smart phone browsers support at least one of the 2 CSS or JavaScript. There is also the benefit of a site being viewable in the widest number of browsers out there.</blockquote></p>
    <p><blockquote> Everyone will not get the same experience, but the fact that someone using an outdated or obsolete browser can still view your site's content can lead to more vistors or customers. Sites that use the Progressive Enhancement approach don't need to do any extra work to make this possible.</blockquote></p>
