    <h2><blockquote> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement </blockquote></h2>
    <p><blockquote>A brief description of Progressive Enhancement would be a blueprint in web design that puts prominence or importance on web content first. It focuses more on the content than the browser support technologies and support. This technique involves separating the visual elements of the presentation semantics or the Linked Data from the content, with presentation being implemented in one or more layers, activated based on aspects of the internet connection of the user. It's a design ideaology that provides a baseline of content and functionality to many users, especially those with experience using the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.  </blockquote></p>
    <p><blockquote> Progressive Enhancement improves the users experience. Buildig a site with Progressive Enhancement makes the site easier to maintain than other sites. Not only does PE benefit users who are using outdated browsers, it also benefits other user browsers such as Mobile browsers. Mobile browsers that don't support CSS or JavaScript can still display the content of a web site. While some of the modern smart phone browsers support at least one of the 2 CSS or JavaScript. There is also the benefit of a site being viewable in the widest number of browsers out there.</blockquote></p>
    <p><blockquote> Everyone will not get the same experience, but the fact that someone using an outdated or obsolete browser can still view your site's content can lead to more vistors or customers. Sites that use the Progressive Enhancement approach don't need to do any extra work to make this possible.</blockquote></p>

    <h2><blockquote> Dragon Project Revision and Reflection </blockquote></h2>
    <p><blockquote>For the revision of my SpaceX-Dragon assignment I had 2 close friends to review my work. My best friend Kim and my close friend Braziel. While both were impressed with the final result, only one had suggestive input regarding some sort of change. Kim's suggestion was on the Contact page to shorten the name and email fields to look like the aside. One side would display the first and last name along with the email address. The other side would only have the subject box. With the remaining space, she suggested I add my logo.</blockquote></p>
    <p><blockquote>On the other hand, Braziel thought it was really good. He also disagreed with the suggestion Kim made and his reasoning was that there would be too much tabbing and it would cause confusion. In his opinion, it is easier to manage the way it is. It flows well, the colors are synced throughout, everything is legible with images as an attraction for the younger crowd. He was very surprised and proud of my work, as was Kim.</blockquote></p>
    <p><blockquote>This has truly been a great experience. I had no skills what so ever in web design, HTML,CSS nor Javascript. Because of this class I now know how to get a web page started. I know to ask more questions than needed to get as much information for a client in the event that I created a web page for someone. I know how to add contact pages and connect multiple pages that do things.(slideshow) I think I have enough experience to continue learning new things. I really wanted to get more into Javascript as that is what's used at my job. </blockquote></p>
    <p><blockquote>If I had to start over I would have just worked harder. I wanted to try a lot of other things but I didn't have the time to do it. I would have asked more questions during class. Things I did well was pay attention and participating with the class. I like that there were recordings to review if I was stuck or couldn't remember something. I'm glad I took notes because that helped when the surprise quiz popped up.</blockquote></p>
    <p><blockquote>The feedback I received from Professor T is as follows:
    <ol>
    <li>Match my pages with the content.</li>
    <blockquote>Which was done by making sure the Home page was synced with the Dragon home page content, the History Page was synced to the History content, and etc...</blockquote>
    <li>Add a max-width to every page that was stretched from edge to edge</li>
    <blockquote>I did not do this because correcting my validation caused me to have to remove most of the max-width's.</blockquote>
    <li>Externalize the accordion script to its own file</li>
    <blockquote>I didn't do this because I did not know how.</blockquote>
    
    </ol>
    <p>To conclude, I'm glad I was a part of this class. I learned a lot of new things about class and myself. I ran into issues that I didn't allow to stop me from getting the job done. If I had to do it again, I would only help Manasa when she's working with everyone in lab. It was a pleasure working with her. I feel her time and knowledge were a bit limited while working with several students during a 1 hour period of time. Overall, this was a very knowledgable class that anyone can pass as long as they stay focused, attentive, and ask plenty of questions.</p>
